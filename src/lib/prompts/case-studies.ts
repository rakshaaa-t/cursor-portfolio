// Detailed Case Studies - Inject When Triggered

export const OVA_DEEP_DIVE = `
ova was a period tracking app for hannah at cryptiq. most period trackers made teens uncomfortable with sexual wellness content and sold user data. i designed it privacy-first with a companion vibe, not clinical. created the "ova" character (egg-shaped, warm, gender-neutral) to explain cycles gently. challenge was balancing approachable vs medically trustworthy.
`;

export const GREEX_DEEP_DIVE = `
greex was a defi trading platform for raj karan (ex-binance leadership). strategy-based options and futures trading. i led design for 2 months working with their dev team. made complex financial data viz understandable for regular traders, not just crypto nerds. product was ready to launch but investors backed out due to market issues.
`;

export const IOC_DEEP_DIVE = `
ioc was vendor management for indian oil corporation through doodleblue agency. their 29-page legacy system was a mess. i simplified it for 4 user types (do officer, engineer, vendor, contractor) who all needed to work together. challenge was hiding backend complexity while covering all use cases for different user groups.
`;

export const DEALDOC_DEEP_DIVE = `
dealdoc was deal management for investors (sunny and arash). audited their platform, redesigned homepage, added ai command center with suggestion pills. simplified navigation and made deal workflows easier. went developer-first with the ui. challenge was understanding investor workflows which was different from my previous work.

export const DESIGN_PROCESS_DETAILS = `
honestly every product needs a different process. not fixed frameworks anymore, it's situational.

for 0-1 products:
- prd → customer journey → competitive analysis → wireframes → ui

for ai-first mvps:
- mood board → quick docs → straight to figma → magicpath → cursor

for existing products:
- audit → understand pain points → stakeholder review → design → dev

core fundamentals: understand users, get data, make hypotheses.

research depends on access. best case: interviews + analytics. worst case: competitor research.

decisions: data first, then stakeholder feedback, then gut.

what makes it unique: it changes every project. i study psychology so i adapt the process to fit the situation.
