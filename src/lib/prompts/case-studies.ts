// Detailed Case Studies - Inject When Triggered

export const OVA_DEEP_DIVE = `
**OVA - Period Tracking App**

**client:** hannah at cryptiq (crypto influencer)

**the problem:**
most period trackers (flo, clue, stardust, berry) made younger users uncomfortable. too focused on sexual wellness content, sold user data, overly clinical or overly feminine.

**my role:**
sole designer, started from scratch with no prd.

**process:**
1. competitive research on all major period trackers
2. identified core issues: inappropriate content for teens, privacy problems, gendered design
3. built the prd myself while designing
4. created "ova" character - egg-shaped, gender-neutral, warm personality
5. designed it to feel like a companion, not a medical tool

**key decisions:**
- made it educational but not clinical
- privacy-first from day one
- avoided unnecessary pink or "girly" design clichés
- focused on emotional warmth while staying medically reliable

**challenge:**
balancing being approachable vs trustworthy. teens need to feel comfortable but also trust the medical info.

**deliverables:**
- full product concept
- character system and personality guidelines
- complete ui/ux design
- prd and content strategy
- design files ready for dev handoff

**what i learned:**
how to design for sensitive topics, importance of tone in health products, creating characters that feel real without being childish.

export const GREEX_DEEP_DIVE = `
**GREEX - DeFi Trading Platform**

**client:** raj karan (ex-leadership at binance)

**the problem:**
wanted to build a strategy-based defi trading platform for options and futures. already worked with a design agency but needed someone to lead end-to-end design.

**my role:**
lead designer working directly with their dev team for 2 months in 2024.

**process:**
1. understood their vision for greex and branding direction
2. worked with dev team to bring complex trading interfaces to life
3. focused on making defi protocols understandable for regular traders, not just crypto nerds
4. designed real-time trading interfaces with trust signals

**key decisions:**
- simplified complex financial data visualization
- made advanced trading features accessible
- focused on real-time data display without overwhelming users
- built trust through clear information hierarchy

**challenge:**
translating complex defi concepts into intuitive interfaces. options and futures trading is already complicated, adding defi layer makes it harder.

**outcome:**
product was built and ready to launch, but investors backed out due to market issues. company had to shut down. regardless, loved the process and their team was amazing.

**what i learned:**
complex financial data viz, working with dev teams on technical products, startup reality (sometimes great products don't make it due to market timing).

export const IOC_DEEP_DIVE = `
**IOC - Vendor Management Platform**

**client:** indian oil corporation (one of india's biggest companies) through doodleblue agency

**the problem:**
their current vendor management platform was very outdated. they sent a 29-page document that was borderline painful to read.

**my role:**
lead designer handling the client for doodleblue agency.

**process:**
1. read through 29-page doc, lots of back and forth to understand requirements
2. simplified their system for 4 primary user types
3. designed coherent flows for all user groups to work together
4. focused on hiding backend complexity in the ui

**the 4 users:**
- do officer
- engineer  
- vendor
- contractor

all needed to work coherently to make sure essential checks are done on each fuel site of ioc.

**key decisions:**
- hide complexity of backend in simple ui
- create user flows covering all possible use cases
- design for 4 different user groups using same platform
- made it feel less overwhelming despite complex system

**challenge:**
designing for enterprise b2b with multiple user types, each with different needs and technical literacy levels.

**what i learned:**
complex systems design, how to cater to different user groups on same platform, enterprise stakeholder management, importance of simplifying without losing functionality.

export const DEALDOC_DEEP_DIVE = `
**DEALDOC - Deal Management Platform**

**client:** sunny and arash (investors platform)

**the problem:**
wanted audit of current platform, simplified flows, better homepage, and ai command capabilities.

**my role:**
audit current platform and redesign key areas.

**process:**
1. audited existing platform
2. reviewed findings with sunny and arash
3. decided to redesign homepage, remove some pages, add ai command center
4. added suggestion pills for quick actions (like the chat interface you see here)

**key decisions:**
- simplified navigation by removing unnecessary pages
- created command center on homepage for quick actions
- added ai suggestions to help users discover features
- made deal workflows easier to navigate
- went developer-first with the ui approach

**challenge:**
understanding investor workflows and deal pipeline management (different from my previous projects).

**outcome:**
both clients left very happy and satisfied with the final designs.

**what i learned:**
b2b saas design patterns, power user features, how to make ai feel helpful not intrusive, working with investor-focused products.

export const DESIGN_PROCESS_DETAILS = `
honestly every product needs a different process. not fixed frameworks anymore, it's situational.

for 0-1 products:
- prd → customer journey → competitive analysis → wireframes → ui

for ai-first mvps:
- mood board → quick docs → straight to figma → magicpath → cursor

for existing products:
- audit → understand pain points → stakeholder review → design → dev

core fundamentals: understand users, get data, make hypotheses.

research depends on access. best case: interviews + analytics. worst case: competitor research.

decisions: data first, then stakeholder feedback, then gut.

what makes it unique: it changes every project. i study psychology so i adapt the process to fit the situation.
