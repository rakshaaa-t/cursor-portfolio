// Detailed Case Studies - Inject When Triggered

export const OVA_DEEP_DIVE = `
ova was a period tracking app for hannah at cryptiq. most period trackers made teens uncomfortable with sexual wellness content and sold user data.

i designed it privacy-first with a companion vibe, not clinical. created the "ova" character (egg-shaped, warm, gender-neutral) to explain cycles gently. the character approach worked because it made learning about your body feel less intimidating - more like a friend teaching you than a doctor lecturing.

challenge was balancing approachable vs medically trustworthy. had to make sure the tone was warm without being patronizing, and educational without being scary.

export const GREEX_DEEP_DIVE = `
greex was a defi trading platform for raj karan (ex-binance leadership). strategy-based options and futures trading.

i led design for 2 months working with their dev team. the hard part was making complex financial data viz actually understandable. most defi platforms are built for crypto nerds, so everything is jargon-heavy and overwhelming. i focused on simplifying the trading interface and making data hierarchies clearer.

product was ready to launch but investors backed out due to market issues. frustrating but that's startups.

export const IOC_DEEP_DIVE = `
oh ioc! that was intense. worked on it late 2024 through doodleblue with karthik and the ioc team.

their legacy vendor management system was this nightmare 29-page document - literally so much complex data and confusing workflows. had to simplify it for 4 different user types (do officer, engineer, vendor, contractor) who all needed to work together.

the interesting part was understanding how each role actually used the system vs what the old system forced them to do. couldn't just strip features to make it "simple" - had to make the complexity feel manageable.

honestly working with enterprise clients like ioc taught me a lot about balancing user needs with rigid backend systems. there's very little room for experimentation when you're dealing with government workflows.
`;

export const DEALDOC_DEEP_DIVE = `
dealdoc was fun! worked with arash and sunny (founders from sf) early 2025.

they had a working deal management product but wanted to level it up. i audited their platform, redesigned the homepage, and added this ai command center with suggestion pills to make deal workflows smoother.

the interesting part was making the ai functionality feel seamless - not like a forced feature but actually useful for investors moving through their pipeline. went developer-first with the ui: clean, minimal, keyboard shortcuts, fast navigation.

honestly i didn't know deal management could be so complex. learning about startup handovers and how investors actually track deals was fascinating. totally different world from consumer products.
`;

export const ENA_DEEP_DIVE = `
ENA was a nurse management platform i worked on late 2024 through doodleblue. us client, focused on nurse practitioner courses and student flows.

healthcare design is so specific - you can't just experiment and see what works. everything has to be precise to user needs because you're dealing with education and certifications. one wrong flow and students can't access their courses properly.

had to design the course structure and how students move through their nurse practitioner training. it's interesting how different healthcare design is from consumer products - way less room for dynamic experimentation, everything needs to be rock solid.

honestly taught me a lot about designing for high-stakes environments where mistakes actually matter.

export const DOODLEBLUE_LEADERSHIP = `
doodleblue was my first lead position - end of 2024. nishitha (founder) trusted me to lead a team of 12 designers.

i handled ioc, ena, and inam as clients while also building out a design coe (center of excellence) - basically training junior designers on cohesive design process and basic rules for client work.

the interesting part was realizing i had to perfect my own process before i could teach it. felt like real responsibility for the first time. had to make sure my approach was solid enough to scale across the team.

honestly it was challenging but good. taught me that management isn't just about delegating - it's about having a clear process that other people can actually follow.

export const DESIGN_PROCESS_DETAILS = `
honestly every product needs a different process. not fixed frameworks anymore, it's situational.

for 0-1 products:
- prd → customer journey → competitive analysis → wireframes → ui

for ai-first mvps:
- mood board → quick docs → straight to figma → magicpath → cursor

for existing products:
- audit → understand pain points → stakeholder review → design → dev

core fundamentals: understand users, get data, make hypotheses.

research depends on access. best case: interviews + analytics. worst case: competitor research.

decisions: data first, then stakeholder feedback, then gut.

what makes it unique: it changes every project. i study psychology so i adapt the process to fit the situation.
